**FilmCritic** is a mobile app built with **React Native**, designed to provide a cinematic experience for browsing and exploring movies.

- Better scalability for real-world apps

- 📋 **Details Screen**: Movie information with title, rating, banner, and overview
- 🧭 **Dynamic Header**:
  - Logo on the home screen
  - Transparent header with back button and centered title on movie detail
- 💫 **Animations & Navigation**: Smooth transitions between screens
